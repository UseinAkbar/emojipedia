      <span class="content__emoji">🙉 Hear-No-Evil Monkey</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        The hear no evil monkey, called Kikazaru (Japanese for “hear not”), one of the Three Wise Monkeys. Depicted as the brown 🐵 Monkey Face with tan or pinkish hands covering its ears. The Three Wise Monkeys represent the proverb see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, frequently interpreted as a call to discretion or figure for willful ignorance. Often used as a playful way to convey I can’t believe what I’m hearing! or, more generally, express astonishment or disbelief.
