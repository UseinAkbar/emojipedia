    <div class="content__box">
      <span class="content__emoji">🤬 Face with Symbols on Mouth</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        An angry-red face with a black bar and white grawlixes covering its mouth, indicating it's swearing or being vulgar. Grawlixes are typographical symbols (e.g., @#$%&!) representing swear words or obscenities. Often used to convey an outburst of anger, frustration, or rage. Most platforms feature the same eyes as on their 😠 Angry Face.

    <div class="content__box">
      <span class="content__emoji">😅 Grinning Face with Sweat</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        Has the same grin and eyes as 😄 Grinning Face With Smiling Eyes but with a single, blue bead of sweat, usually over its left eye. Intended to depict nerves or discomfort but commonly used to express a close call, as if saying Whew! and wiping sweat from the forehead.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content__box">
      <span class="content__emoji">😜 Winking Face with Tongue</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        A yellow face sticking out its tongue and making a zany wink, usually shown with its right eye closed and left wide open. Often conveys a sense of fun, excitement, wackiness, buffoonery, or joking. Generally goofier than 😛 Face With Tongue and 😝 Squinting Face With Tongue but less "crazy" than 🤪 Zany Face.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content__box">
      <span class="content__emoji">😱 Face Screaming in Fear</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        A yellow face screaming in fear, depicted by wide, white eyes, a long, open mouth, hands pressed on cheeks, and a pale blue forehead, as if it has lost its color. Its expression evokes Edvard Munch’s iconic painting The Scream. While intended to represent horror and fright, it commonly conveys such feelings as shock, awe, disbelief, and intense excitement, as a screaming fan.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content__box">
      <span class="content__emoji">💩 Pile of Poo</span>
      <p class="content__text">
        A swirl of brown poop, shaped like soft-serve ice cream with large, excited eyes and a big, friendly smile. May be used to represent feces and other bathroom topics as well as stand in for their many related slang terms. It also enjoys a wide range of idiosyncratic applications, such as conveying a sense of whimsy or silliness, given its fun, happy expression.
